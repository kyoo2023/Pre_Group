# Group 4 Solution
Group Course by Group4

## Purpose of this project
This Project simulates a Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system and outputs some VTK files for visualization.<br>
Besides, we implement these 3 test for the system:<br>
1. Check that the type of the model parameters (F, k) matches that of the element type of the u and v vectors.
2. Check that the variables u and v are the same size.
3. Check that the simulation produces the mathematically correct answer when u = 0 and v = 0.
